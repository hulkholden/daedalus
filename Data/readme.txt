What is Daedalus?


Daedalus is a Nintendo 64 emulator for Windows, macOS, Linux and PSP. Daedalus is named after
the craftsman at King Minos's court who designed the labyrinth for the Minotaur.

Getting the Latest Version
**************************
Visit http://sourceforge.net/projects/daedalusx64/ and if you can compile you
may compile the latest alpha otherwise source it off the net elsewhere.


About this Release
******************

This release of DaedalusX64 is currently in beta stages of development.

As for the past releases of Daedalus PSP, this project is intended to show the
potential for a N64 emulator on the PSP, but the current release has many
missing features that make it far from usable:

* Some roms won't boot.
* Some roms have serious graphical glitches.
* Some roms have random lockups and crashes, or run slowly.

Having said all that, We believe most of these problems can be overcome in the
near future.


Using Daedalusx64
**************

Installation
------------

Copy the Daedalus folder to the \PSP\GAME\ folder on your PSP.

Daedalus requires Custom Firmware 4.00 or higher and will not work on earlier firmwares


Upgrade Procedure
-----------------

Get the latest build from subversion / compiled in mirror
Remove all HLE files from the SaveGames folder
Remove rom.db and preferences.ini

This will ensure that Daedalus is fresh.

Roms
----

Roms can be placed in two locations, either the Daedalus Folder Rom directory or
you can create a directory in the root of the memory stick (eg: F:\N64\).

Daedalus supports most rom formats (.v64, .z64, .rom etc)

We support zipped roms, however if zipped the rom will extract itself onto the
memory stick anyway so it defeats the purpose of having a zipped rom. If you are
running low on space, it is recommended that you extract the rom you want into
the Rom Directory.


Preview Pictures
----------------

All previews are included in a stable release or on subversion.

Preview pictures can be found in Resources\Preview which you can modify to your
liking. The Pictures are required to be in .png format, in a 4:3 aspect ratio.

To let Daedalusx64 know which picture to use for each rom, you need to add a
line to the corresponding entry in the main roms.ini file, with this format:

Preview=<filename.png>

Save Games
----------

All the save game types are currently supported, if you have issues saving any
game, check the roms.ini and make sure the save type is correct.

Save games are created with the same name as the rom file, in the
Daedalusx64/SaveGames/ directory.

IMPORTANT NOTE: For performance reasons Daedalus only saves out
modified save game every 60 vbl.

Save States
-----------

All the save states are created using this name format : SaveSlotXX.ss (XX can
be from 0 to 63) Save States are saved by default at
Daedalusx64/SaveStates/<gamename>/. But you can also create this directory
ms0:/n64/SaveSates and Daedalus will use this directory for save state creation
and loading.

In total there's 64 slots for save states, each game has its own 64 slots to
choose. You can delete any save state easily, just choose the slot you want to
delete and press square and then press triangle to confirm.

Main Menu
---------

When you first run DaedalusX64 you will be presented with a nice list of your
games. To select a game you will press DPad left or right then X to select a
title, there's various options you can choose from in the menu, every option is
explained. To cycle through options screens use the left and right shoulder
buttons.

Pause Menu
----------

When a rom is running, you can access the Pause Menu by pressing the 'Home'
button.

From the Pause Menu you can use the left and right shoulder buttons to access
various option screens. You can use the Pause Menu to take screenshots and reset
the emulator to the main menu. Screenshots are saved under the
Dumps/<gamename>/ScreenShots/ directory in the Daedalus folder on your memory
stick.

You can press the 'Home' button again to quickly return to the emulator.

Controls
--------

When and indeed if :) the rom runs, the following controls are mapped
by default:

N64                 PSP
Start               Start
Analogue Stick      Analogue Stick
Dpad                O (Circle) + Dpad
A                   X (Cross)
B                   [] (Square)
Z                   ^ (Triangle)
L Trigger           L Trigger
R Trigger           R Trigger
C buttons           Dpad (Circle unpressed)
Menu                Home

Daedalusx allows user-configurable controls to be specified. The desired
controls can be chosen from the Rom Settings screen.

In order to define your own controller configuration you need to add a new .ini
file to the Daedalus/ControllerConfigs directory. There are a few examples
provided which should give an overview of what is possible.
