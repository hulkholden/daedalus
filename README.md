# NOTICE: This repository has moved!
As of March 2019, we've decided to move to a separate repository because forked repositories do not have the same abilities as fresh repos. Check out https://github.com/DaedalusX64/daedalus for the new repository with releases, source code and up-to-date information.

# DaedalusX64
 
DaedalusX64 is a Nintendo 64 emulator for Linux and PSP, with plans to port to Windows, Mac, PS Vita among other platforms. The PSP port is noteworthy for being the fastest N64 emulator ever on the platform, achieving close to or even full speed in many titles.
 
## Features:
 
- Fast emulation
- High compatibility
- Support for PSP TV Mode with 480p output!
- Active support and updates
- Lots of experimental optimizations
 
And more!
 
## Usage
 
To install Daedalus to your PSP, download the latest release from the Releases page: https://github.com/z2442/daedalus/releases
 
Next, plug your PSP into your computer and navigate to /PSP/GAME/. Create a folder called "daedalus" there, and place the EBOOT.PBP file inside. Place your ROM files in daedalus/Roms/ and they will automatically appear in Daedalus.
 
Note: If the release is a ZIP file with a folder containing an EBOOT.PBP file when extracted, simply drag and drop the extracted folder into /PSP/GAME/.
